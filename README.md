# Building a Smart Multi-Level Parking System

## The Problem

As urbanization grows, parking spaces are becoming scarce and inefficiently utilized. In a multi-level parking structure, finding an optimal parking spot is a challenge for drivers and parking operators alike. Factors like vehicle size, duration of parking, and current parking occupancy further complicate the problem. Traditional systems often fail to provide real-time solutions for these challenges.

## The Solution

To address this, I designed a Smart Parking System (SPS) that incorporates advanced algorithms to optimize parking operations. This system uses a multi-level parking structure (10 levels) and takes into account various parameters, including:

- Vehicle size (small, medium, large)
- Expected parking duration
- Current parking status of each level
- Floor-specific occupancy and weight distribution
- Driver preferences (e.g., proximity to exit/entrance)

The system is powered by a combination of algorithms that dynamically assign, manage, and release parking spaces. Below, I outline the algorithms used, the architecture, and the complete implementation.

## Algorithms

### 1. **Floor Selection Algorithm**
Objective: Select the optimal floor based on current occupancy, vehicle size, and weight distribution.

#### Steps:
1. Calculate occupancy rate for each floor.
2. Check vehicle size compatibility for each floor.
3. Factor in weight distribution to prevent structural imbalance.
4. Assign a score to each floor based on availability and compatibility.
5. Select the floor with the highest score.

### 2. **Spot Assignment Algorithm**
Objective: Allocate the most suitable parking spot on the selected floor.

#### Steps:
1. Retrieve the parking layout for the selected floor.
2. Filter spots based on size compatibility and availability.
3. Calculate proximity to exits and elevators.
4. Assign the nearest compatible spot.

### 3. **Reservation Algorithm**
Objective: Reserve parking spots for incoming vehicles.

#### Steps:
1. Accept pre-booking requests with vehicle details and duration.
2. Block a suitable spot based on size and duration.
3. Update the real-time parking map.

### 4. **Duration Prediction Algorithm**
Objective: Predict parking duration based on historical data.

#### Steps:
1. Analyze historical data for similar vehicle types and user profiles.
2. Use machine learning models to predict parking duration.
3. Update predictions in real-time based on user input.

### 5. **Pricing Algorithm**
Objective: Dynamically calculate parking fees.

#### Steps:
1. Base the calculation on duration, vehicle size, and floor.
2. Apply surge pricing during peak hours.
3. Offer discounts for longer durations or pre-booking.

### 6. **Real-Time Monitoring Algorithm**
Objective: Continuously monitor and update parking status.

#### Steps:
1. Use IoT sensors to detect vehicle presence.
2. Update the central database with occupancy status.
3. Alert the system in case of anomalies (e.g., unauthorized vehicles).

---

### 7. **Exit Management Algorithm**
Objective: Optimize vehicle exit to reduce congestion.

#### Steps:
1. Identify vehicles nearing their exit time.
2. Prioritize their paths for smooth navigation.
3. Ensure the exit process updates the parking map.

---

### 8. **Overstay Handling Algorithm**
Objective: Manage vehicles exceeding their allocated time.

#### Steps:
1. Notify the driver about the overstayed duration.
2. Apply penalty charges automatically.
3. Suggest alternative spots if required.

---

### 9. **Weight Distribution Algorithm**
Objective: Ensure structural stability by distributing vehicles evenly.

#### Steps:
1. Monitor the weight on each floor in real-time.
2. Re-route vehicles to underutilized floors if necessary.
3. Trigger alerts if weight thresholds are exceeded.

---

### 10. **Driver Assistance Algorithm**
Objective: Assist drivers in navigating to their parking spots.

#### Steps:
1. Provide turn-by-turn navigation using mobile apps or kiosks.
2. Update the route in real-time based on traffic within the parking structure.
3. Alert drivers about their allocated spotâ€™s proximity.
